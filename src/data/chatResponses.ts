    "question": "What is your GPA?",
    "answer": "Maine abhi tak 4 semesters complete kiye hain. Mera CGPA 9.02 hai aur semester-wise GPA hai 8.67, 9.15, 8.93 & 9.33."
  },
  {
    "question": "Senior, how do I improve my GPA in the next semester?",
    "answer": "GPA improve karne ke liye thoda strategy aur mehnat dono chahiye! Pehle dekho kaunse subjects me dikkat aayi thi last semester. Concepts samjho, regular practice karo. Lectures miss mat karo, actively participate karo, aur doubt ho to pooch lo. Dosto ke saath study group bana lo, difficult topics discuss karo. Ek study schedule banao, har subject ko time do. Aur haan, health ka bhi dhyaan rakho – sahi neend, sahi khana, kam stress!"
  },
  {
    "question": "Senior, my GPA dropped a bit this semester, but I think I understood the material. How much does the numerical GPA matter compared to actual subject knowledge?",
    "answer": "Yeh classic tension hai! Dekho, GPA ka importance hai – internships ya grad school ke liye pehla filter hota hai. Lekin asli knowledge long-term me jyada kaam aata hai. Agar concepts samajh liye hain, toh projects aur interviews me woh dikh jayega, jo GPA se bhi important hai. GPA trend improve karte raho, lekin sirf numbers ke liye samajhdaari sacrifice mat karo."
  },
  {
    "question": "I'm finding it tough to balance studying for theoretical subjects like TOC with practical coding for DSA. How did you handle both?",
    "answer": "Theory aur practice ka juggle sabko tough lagta hai! TOC jaise subjects ke liye focused, deep thinking chahiye – subah fresh mind se padh lo. DSA ke liye roz thoda-thoda practice karo, pattern samjho. Main khud theory din me karta tha, coding shaam ko. Dono ko balance karo, kyunki aage jaake dono kaam aayenge."
  },
  {
    "question": "My first year GPA is lower than I hoped, around 7.5. I'm aiming for top companies for placements. Is this GPA going to prevent me?",
    "answer": "7.5 GPA first year me theek hai, sab companies ke liye nahi, but bahut saari companies me chance hai. Zaroori hai ki aage ke semesters me GPA improve karo. Top companies overall profile dekhti hain: GPA trend, projects, internships, aur technical interviews. Abhi se mehnat karo, projects banao, GPA upar le jao – sab possible hai!"
  },
  {
    "question": "Feeling demotivated because a subject is really hard and my grades aren't great. How do you push through that feeling of 'I'm not good enough'?",
    "answer": "Har engineer ko kabhi na kabhi aisa feel hota hai! Difficult subject sabko tough lagta hai, sirf tumhe nahi. Low grades ko apni value ka measure mat banao. Dekho, kahan dikkat aa rahi hai, usko chhote parts me tod do, kisi dost ya prof se pooch lo. Ek ek concept samajhna bhi achievement hai! Regular try karte raho, wahi asli engineering hai."
  },
  {
    "question": "Senior, how can I make sure I'm actually learning in labs and not just finishing the steps?",
    "answer": "Lab me sirf steps follow karne se kuch nahi hota. Lab se pehle manual padh lo, objective samjho. Lab ke time pe har step ka reason samjho, output ka matlab samjho. Report likhte waqt sirf procedure mat likho, results aur errors explain karo. Theory se connect karo, tabhi lab ka fayda hai."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key differences between procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming paradigms? It's a bit confusing.",
    "answer": "Samjho, yeh teen tareeke hain code likhne ke. Procedural (jaise C) – step by step functions me code likhna. Object-Oriented (jaise Java, C++) – data aur functions ko objects me bundle karna, inheritance, polymorphism use karna. Functional (jaise Haskell, ya Python/JS me functions) – sab kuch functions ke through, state change kam, maths jaisa approach. Aajkal ke languages me sab mix milta hai."
  },
  {
    "question": "My first-semester GPA is set. What GPA should I aim for in the next semesters to significantly improve my overall CGPA by the end of the second year?",
    "answer": "CGPA boost karne ke liye agli semesters me consistently high GPA chahiye – ideally 8.5 ya 9.0+ target karo. Aage ke semesters me credits bhi zyada hote hain, toh unka impact bhi zyada hota hai. Apne credit hours ke hisaab se calculate karo, lekin high aim karo, tabhi CGPA upar jayega."
  },
  {
    "question": "Feeling really stressed and anxious about job placements in a few years. How do you handle future career pressure?",
    "answer": "Future ka pressure sabko hota hai, lekin abhi jo control me hai uspe focus karo: academics strong banao, projects pe kaam karo, internships dhundo, network banao. Placement prep ek process hai, har semester thoda thoda karo. Ek saath sab mat socho, chhote steps lo."
  },
  {
    "question": "Senior, what's the real importance of theory in subjects like Algorithms or TOC? It feels like problem-solving is all that matters.",
    "answer": "Theory tumhe 'kyun' aur 'kahan tak' ka answer deti hai. Algorithms me Big O samajhna sirf academic nahi hai, woh batata hai ki kaunsa approach scalable hai. TOC me pata chalta hai kya possible hai, kya impossible. Theory samajhoge toh naye, tough problems solve kar paoge, sirf known problems nahi."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do concepts from Computer Networks (CN) apply in everyday life or in typical engineering jobs?",
    "answer": "CN har jagah hai! Internet use karte ho, email bhejte ho, video stream karte ho – sab me networks ka role hai. Engineering jobs me distributed systems, web apps, security, hardware devices – sab me CN concepts lagte hain. Protocols, IP addresses, routing, bandwidth – yeh sab basics hai."
  },
  {
    "question": "My GPA is good, but I feel like I just memorized stuff for exams and don't really understand it deeply. Is this going to hurt me later?",
    "answer": "GPA academic performance dikhata hai, lekin deep understanding nahi. Sirf ratta maaroge toh projects, internships, ya advanced courses me dikkat hogi. Purane concepts ko dobara samjho, khud explain karo, application-based problems solve karo. Samajh dheere-dheere build hoti hai."
  },
  {
    "question": "Feeling like an imposter – everyone else seems to grasp engineering concepts faster than me. How do you deal with imposter syndrome?",
    "answer": "Imposter syndrome sabko hota hai, especially engineering me! Dusre log bhi struggle karte hain, bas dikhate nahi. Apni learning pe focus karo, dusron se compare mat karo. Apni choti achievements ko bhi recognize karo. Kisi se baat karo – pata chalega tum akela nahi ho."
  },
  {
    "question": "Senior, what are the most common types of database models and when would I use each one?",
    "answer": "Sabse common hai Relational (SQL) aur Non-Relational (NoSQL). Relational (MySQL, PostgreSQL) – structured tables, fixed schema, complex queries, transactions. NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra) – flexible, unstructured data, scale karne me easy. Data structure aur access pattern ke hisaab se choose karo."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is getting a high GPA in core engineering subjects more important for job applications than a high overall CGPA?",
    "answer": "Technical jobs ke liye core subjects me high GPA jyada important hota hai. Employers dekhte hain ki tum apne field ke main subjects me strong ho. Overall CGPA bhi matter karta hai, lekin core subjects ka GPA jyada highlight hota hai."
  },
  {
    "question": "Feeling stressed about the future – what if I don't get a good job after graduating? How do you stay positive?",
    "answer": "Tension lena normal hai, lekin ek cheez pe sab nahi tikta. Profile strong banao: skills, projects, internships, networking. Job market up-down hota hai, lekin skilled logon ki demand rehti hai. Abhi ke steps pe focus karo, future ki tension kam ho jayegi."
  },
  {
    "question": "Senior, how do you effectively study for subjects that are purely theoretical and don't have numerical problems?",
    "answer": "Theory subjects ke liye active learning karo – khud ke words me summarize karo, diagrams banao, kisi ko samjhao, flashcards banao. Concepts ke beech ka logical flow samjho, sirf definitions mat ratto. Discussion karo, tabhi theory samajh aayegi."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does understanding Computer Organization and Architecture (COA) help me in programming?",
    "answer": "COA se pata chalta hai ki code run karte waqt computer andar kya kar raha hai. Memory hierarchy, CPU instructions, data representation – yeh sab samajhoge toh efficient code likh paoge, performance bottlenecks samajh paoge, aur debugging bhi easy ho jayega."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the most common types of algorithms that every engineering student should know well?",
    "answer": "Sorting (Merge, Quick), Searching (Binary), Graph traversal (BFS, DFS), Dynamic Programming, Greedy – yeh sab basic algorithms hai. Inki complexity aur use cases samajhna zaroori hai."
  },
